# PaintBids
PaintBids is our auction website for the Web Technology hand-in assignment. It is about selling pieces of classical art on pretty affordable prices.
The website is packed with useful features to help the user navigate and make up their mind about which painting to bid on, so take a good look around!
##Description
- Users :
The users are hardcoded in the backend with hashed passwords (the actual password is commented out for testing purposes), and they are with similar structure: test1@test.com (password: @Password1), 
all the way to 5.

In the controllers all CRUD actions can be performed, and the middleware restrict the editing and deletion of a user only for logged in administrators.
A new user can be created with the desired e-mail, username, password and authorization with a post request and so on.

```bash
